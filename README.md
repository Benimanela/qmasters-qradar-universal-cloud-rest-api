## IBM QRadar Universal Cloud Connector
The QRadar Universal Cloud REST API is a powerful feature that helps enhance visibility by easily gathering data from a wide range of REST API cloud-based applications and services. With the Universal Cloud REST API Protocol, users can create log sources for REST API compatible data sources that are not currently supported officially by IBM. This allows organizations to quickly and easily connect to cloud-based or on-premise endpoints that were previously inaccessible.

The Universal Cloud REST API Protocol includes pre-configured workflows for select data sources, which can significantly reduce the time required to create new log sources. Moreover, users can tailor the data to their specific use cases by defining normalized properties, classifying event data, and extracting custom event properties using the DSM Editor.
By connecting their data sources with the Universal Cloud REST API Protocol, organizations can enhance their threat detection capabilities, and analysts can easily access critical investigation information in their workspace using QRadar's Analyst Workflow. This minimizes the need to navigate elsewhere for additional context. In summary, the QRadar Universal Cloud REST API is a powerful tool that helps organizations adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape and improve their security posture.


## Supported version
Universal Cloud REST API protocol is supported on QRadar 7.3.2 or later, and the QRadar Log Source Management app must be installed.

## Terminology
#### Universal Cloud Rest Api terms:

Workflow: An XML document that outlines the event retrieval process. It defines one or more parameters, which can have assigned values within the XML or derive values from the Workflow Parameter Values XML document. The Workflow consists of several actions that run sequentially. When the Workflow is initiated, the parameter values are included in the State. As the Workflow progresses, actions can access and modify the State.

Workflow Parameter Values: The input parameters for a Workflow instance, stored in an XML file. These values consist of key/value pairs, and each key must match a parameter defined in the corresponding Workflow.
